# Synonym-Generator

A very basic python Synonym Generator. Tell a word and the number of synonyms you want. It will output the synonyms in the integrated terminal. 
Currently, it should be run inside of VSCode and is not an app. 

Limitations:
1. WORDS TO CHOOSE FROM: bloom, doom, cat, zoom
2. Only a few synonyms can be asked.
